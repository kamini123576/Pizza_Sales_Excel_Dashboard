# Overview: Pizza Sales Analysis and Dashboard <br>
This project involves analyzing the sales performance of a fictional pizza store using SQL queries. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and create a dashboard for better understanding and decision-making.<br>

**Objective** <br>
1. Analyze pizza sales data to derive key performance indicators (KPIs).<br>
2. Uncover sales trends based on various dimensions like time, category, and size.<br>
3. Highlight top and bottom-performing products.<br>
4. Provide actionable insights through a visual dashboard<br>

**Steps** <br>
**1. Data Preprocessing** <br>
Ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.<br>
**Steps**:<br>
. Handle missing or inconsistent values.<br>
. Validate the data types for numeric, categorical, and datetime fields.<br>
. Remove duplicates if necessary.<br>
. Normalize and standardize data formats (e.g., date format, capitalization).<br>

**2. Analysis Using SQL** <br>
The following analyses were conducted using SQL queries:<br>
**A. KPI Analysis** <br>
. Total Revenue: Sum of all order prices.<br>
. Average Order Value: Average revenue per order.<br>
. Total Pizzas Sold: Sum of pizzas sold.<br>
. Total Orders Placed: Count of distinct orders.<br>
. Average Pizzas Per Order: Ratio of pizzas sold to orders.<br>
**B. Trend Analysis** <br>
. Daily Trend: Orders analyzed by weekdays.<br>
. Hourly Trend: Orders analyzed by hour.<br>
**C. Sales by Category and Size** <br>
. % of Sales by Pizza Category: Contribution of each pizza category to total revenue.<br>
. % of Sales by Pizza Size: Contribution of each size to total revenue.<br>
**D. Performance by Products** <br>
. Total Pizzas Sold by Category: Pizza sales by category (filtered by month).<br>
. Top 5 Best Sellers: Top-performing pizzas based on quantity sold.<br>
. Bottom 5 Best Sellers: Least-performing pizzas based on quantity sold.<br>
**3. Dashboard Creation** <br>
Using the insights derived, a dashboard was built to visualize:<br>
. Sales trends over time (daily and hourly).<br>
.Revenue contribution by category and size.<br>
. KPIs at a glance.<br>
. Product performance (top and bottom sellers).<br>


**Summary and Conclusion** <br>
The analysis revealed the following:<br>
**Key Trends:** Identified high-demand time slots and popular categories.<br>
**Performance Metrics:** Highlighted areas of revenue generation and average performance per order.<br>

**Insights for Strategy:** <br>
. Focus on high-performing categories and sizes.<br>
. Consider promotional strategies for underperforming items.<br>
. Optimize staff scheduling for peak hours.<br>
